# ThingsInbox
An Android Companion app for Things 3, allowing the User to simply construct and send off a To-Do item.

The app makes use of the Things 3 URL scheme, alongside the email-to-things functionality. The app constructs JSON,
encodes it in a URL, and sends it to the Users Things address. A To-Do with this link then appears in the app.
The user clicks the link, and it reconstructs the To-Do in the app.
